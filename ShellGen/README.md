# ShellGen
ShellGen is a Python project that generates a reverse shell with SSL encryption and a valid SSL certificate. The generated shell can be used to execute arbitrary commands on a remote machine.

## Usage
The project consists of a single Python script. To use it, simply run the script with the connect_string and fingerprint variables set to the appropriate values.

``` python
python shellgen.py
```

## Features
ShellGen offers the following features:

    SSL encryption: The generated reverse shell is encrypted with SSL to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

    Valid SSL certificate: The reverse shell uses a valid SSL certificate to prevent certificate warnings and errors.

    Interactive shell: The reverse shell provides an interactive shell that allows users to execute arbitrary commands on a remote machine.

    Meterpreter integration: The reverse shell includes support for Meterpreter, a powerful post-exploitation tool used in penetration testing.

    Shellcode injection: The reverse shell can inject custom shellcode into a remote machine.

    Original shell access: The reverse shell provides access to the original shell of the remote machine.
