    - Customizable security rules and patterns to adapt to specific project requirements.
    - Integration with development workflows, including support for popular integrated development environments (IDEs) and code repositories.
    - Real-time feedback and reporting to provide developers with immediate visibility into identified vulnerabilities.
    - Continuous improvement through regular updates to incorporate new security rules and best practices.
