To test the Logger script safely, you can set up a virtual machine (VM) on your computer and run the script inside the VM. This way, any changes made by the script will be isolated within the VM and will not affect your main operating system or files.

The general steps to create a virtual machine and test the Logger script safely:

1. Download and install virtual machine software such as VirtualBox or VMware.

2. Create a new virtual machine and install the operating system of your choice.

3. Install Python on the virtual machine.

4. Copy the Logger script to the virtual machine.

5. Edit the script to include your desired settings, such as Gmail account details.

6. Run the script and verify that it logs startup information and sends the log file to your specified email address.

7. Once you have verified that the script is working as expected, you can safely delete the virtual machine and its associated files. This way, any potential risks or changes made by the script are contained within the virtual machine and will not affect your main operating system or files.
