# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Encoder

This is a Python program that encrypts a message using the NATO Phonetic Alphabet. The program takes a message as input and returns an encrypted message, where each letter of the original message is replaced with a word from the NATO phonetic alphabet.
Installation

To run this program, you'll need Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can download the `nato_alphabet.py` file from this repository and save it on your computer.

## Usage

To use the program, open a terminal window or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the `nato_alphabet.py` file.

Run the program by typing `python nato_alphabet.py` followed by the message you want to encrypt. For example:

```python

python nato_alphabet.py "Hello, World!"
```

The program will return the encrypted message:

``` python
Hotel Echo Lima Lima Oscar, Whiskey Oscar Romeo Lima Delta!
```

## User Interface

Alternatively, you can run the program using the graphical user interface (GUI) provided by the `nato_gui.py` file. To run the GUI, navigate to the directory where you saved the nato_gui.py file and run it using Python:

``` python
python nato_gui.py
```

This will launch a window with a text box where you can enter the message you want to encrypt. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message and display the result in the text box below.
